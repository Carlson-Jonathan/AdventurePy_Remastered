    <h1>Labyrinthia - A Remastered Adventure Game</h1>

    <p>I began teaching myself programming in Python around 2014/2015. As part of my learning journey, 
    I created a text-based adventure game called <strong>"Adventure Story2.py"</strong> which required Python 2. 
    While I didn’t get too advanced in Python at that time, my focus shifted to C++ when I started studying Software 
    Engineering a couple of years later.</p>

    <p>Fast forward a bit, and I was hired by Parsons where my work required both C++ and Python. Coincidentally, 
    my son started college, and one of his early programming assignments involved creating an adventure game similar 
    to the one I originally made. Seeing this as a perfect opportunity to apply more advanced programming concepts, 
    I decided to remake my old game, which I now call <strong>Labyrinthia</strong>.</p>

    <p>This new version of the game is more refined, completed, and cleanly coded. It’s built with better efficiency 
    and modern Python practices, making it a more enjoyable experience for players.</p>
